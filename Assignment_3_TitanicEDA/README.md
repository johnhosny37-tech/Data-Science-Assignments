# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Description
This project analyzes the famous **Titanic Dataset** to explore survival patterns.  
It involves:
- Data cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🚀 Steps Performed
1. Data cleaning (missing values, duplicates).
2. Feature engineering:
   - Family size
   - Alone flag
   - Encoded categorical variables.
3. Visual analysis of:
   - Age groups vs survival
   - Gender vs survival
   - Passenger class distribution
   - Survival by family size & class

## 📊 Example Visualizations
- Survival rate by age group  
- Survival rate by gender  
- Passenger class distribution  
- Heatmap: Family size & class vs survival

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Data visualization
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
